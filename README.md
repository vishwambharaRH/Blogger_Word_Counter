# Blogger_Word_Counter
This extension file finds the total word count of a post that is currently being edited in Blogger.com. 

I made this extension to show that I can build better extensions in the future, and to win a bet.
This was born out of the personal need of one extension, as I am an avid blogger myself, and hate it when I have to keep clicking around and copying stuff to Google Docs to find out the word count (I have stringent requirements).

Quite a lot of blood, sweat and tears were lost in making this extension, as this was my first time dealing with the intricacies of the Chrome Content Security Policy. Tens of hours were spent on asking questions about the same, without any fruitful answer.

The main error that was supposed to be addressed was the requestStorageAccessFor error, that I kept encountering in the beginning, without actually knowing that it was Chrome's own mechanism to deal with page-skimming illegal extensions.

If you wish to download this extension, please be aware that you might need to turn on Developer mode in your browser to access it. Also, it needs to be Chromium.

Hope you like what I've done.

The code is delicate, don't touch it or make any sorts of changes.
